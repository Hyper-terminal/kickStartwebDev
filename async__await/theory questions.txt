why were promises discovered?
promises are cleaner way for running asynchronous tasks to look more like synchronous and also provide catching mechanism which are not in callbacks.



Why are async await better than promise.then design pattern?
Async/Await is used to work with promises in asynchronous functions. It is basically syntactic sugar for promises. It is just a wrapper to restyle code and make promises easier to read and use. It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier to understand.
